00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,340
well I can't see all of you but it's a

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,070
pleasure to be in Baltimore this evening

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,030
okay having said all that our discussion

38
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,790
this evening is psychedelics in the age

39
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,459
of intelligent machines shamans among

40
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,110
the machines and I wanted to talk about

41
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,390
this simply because these are two of my

42
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,020
great loves and so I assume being

43
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,069
monogamous they must be one love so how

44
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,160
to build intellectual bridges between

45
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,940
these two concerns which seem so

46
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,720
different as far as people and machines

47
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,019
are concerned it was good thick von

48
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,959
bertalanffy I think who said in his book

49
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,870
general Systems Theory he said people

50
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,190
are not machines but in every

51
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,650
opportunity where they are allowed to

52
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,229
behave like machines they will so behave

53
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,139
in other words we tend to fall into the

54
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,740
well of habit though the Gori of our

55
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,750
humanists is our spontaneous creativity

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,710
we too as creatures of physics and

57
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,940
chemistry of memory and hope tend to

58
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,729
fall into

59
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,409
repetitious patterns and these

60
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,449
repetitious patterns are the death of

61
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,889
creativity they diminish our humanness

62
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,599
they diminish our individuality make

63
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,659
each of us somehow like cause in some

64
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,979
larger system and we we associate this

65
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,669
caught like membership in larger

66
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,089
soulless systems with the machines that

67
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:13,239
we inherit from the age of the internal

68
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,789
combustion engine the age of the jet

69
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:16,889
engine

70
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,609
you know Marshall McLuhan said we

71
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:23,649
navigate our way into the future like

72
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:26,589
someone driving who uses only the

73
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,619
rearview mirror to tell them where

74
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,199
they're going it's it's not a very

75
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,669
successful strategy for navigating into

76
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,679
the future so I made a number of notes

77
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:45,669
um on this matter of psychedelics and

78
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,649
machines to me the connecting bridge

79
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,469
well there are many but the most obvious

80
00:05:53,469 --> 00:06:01,079
one is consciousness expansion after all

81
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,249
psychedelics before they were called

82
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:05,229
anthea gentleness before they were

83
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,350
called how the center

84
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,660
before they were called psychedelics

85
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,380
they were simply called consciousness

86
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,680
expanding drugs good phenomenological

87
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,460
description of what they do and

88
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,460
certainly the technology of cybernetics

89
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,800
is a consciousness expanding technology

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,210
it expands a different area of

91
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,450
consciousness the minds of machines and

92
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,630
the minds of human beings are very

93
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,360
different so different that each party

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,910
questions whether the other even has a

95
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,470
mind but in fact what these are are

96
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,920
species of minds operating in very

97
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,180
different domains for instance you can

98
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,720
ask a five year old child to going to

99
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,480
the bedroom to the third drawer of the

100
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,510
dresser to select a pair of black socks

101
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,320
and to bring them to mother this is not

102
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,350
a challenge for a five-year-old child to

103
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,080
get a machine to do this is a hundred

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,260
million dollars and a research team of

105
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,710
40 or 50 technicians code writers

106
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,540
working months on the other hand if you

107
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,590
ask a person for the cube root of seven

108
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,210
hundred and fifty thousand three hundred

109
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,960
and forty four much head scratch angry

110
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,520
a computer is utterly undaunted by that

111
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,300
question so computers our minds that

112
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,770
work in the realm of computation and

113
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,590
human minds our minds that work in the

114
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,520
realm of generalization spatial

115
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
coordination understanding of natural

116
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,259
language so forth and so on are these

117
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,380
kinds of mind is so different from each

118
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,349
other pilgrims that there is no bridge

119
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:11,789
to be crossed

120
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,930
I would submit not but in fact the

121
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,780
bridge between the human mind and the

122
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,210
machine mind is symbolic logic

123
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,900
mathematics when we think clearly we are

124
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,599
intelligible to machines people who

125
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,130
write code know this the the essence of

126
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,190
making yourself clear to a machine is to

127
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,029
think clearly yourself the machine has

128
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,410
no patience for the half-truth the

129
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,640
analogy the semi grasp dissociation for

130
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,959
the machine everything has to be clear

131
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,240
everything must be defined

132
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,269
so that's the commonality between minds

133
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,759
and machines of the calculating species

134
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,449
what are the common bridges between

135
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:18,110
psychedelics and these machines well to

136
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,899
my mind this is an easier bridge to gap

137
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,850
both computers and drugs are what I

138
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,249
would call function specific

139
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:32,600
arrangements of matter and as we develop

140
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,019
namma technological abilities as we move

141
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,519
into the next century

142
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,309
it will be more and more clear but the

143
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,860
difference between drugs and machines is

144
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,509
simply that one is too large to swallow

145
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,550
our s people are working on that

146
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,570
you know nanotechnology is a very hot

147
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,910
buzzword at the moment an unimaginable

148
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,200
dream of building machines and small

149
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,300
objects a atom-by-atom

150
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,760
perhaps under the control of long chain

151
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,860
polymers running forms of pre-programmed

152
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,910
software of some sort

153
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,790
it's all very razzmatazz very

154
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,510
state-of-the-art but in fact

155
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,560
pharmaceutical chemists have been

156
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,050
working in the nanotechnological realm

157
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,990
for over a hundred years I mean when you

158
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,320
synthesize these molecules out of

159
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,180
simpler substrate specifically to have a

160
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,070
conformational geometry that matches

161
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,000
something going on in the synapse of a

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,459
primate a human or a monkey or something

163
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,589
like that you are working at this nano

164
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:55,420
technological level both the psychedelic

165
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,950
and the new computational machines

166
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,600
represent extensions of human funk

167
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,590
and this is this is really close to the

168
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,770
knob it has it locks in with the concept

169
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,200
of prosthesis the drugs the psychedelic

170
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,220
substances the shamanic plants are forms

171
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,970
of prosthetic devices for extending the

172
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,790
human mind the human perceptual

173
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,490
apparatus into hidden realms or

174
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,640
inaccessible realms similarly the

175
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,610
machines by allowing us to model

176
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,290
calculate and simulate very complicated

177
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,380
multivariable processes extend the power

178
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,650
of the human mind into places you could

179
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,000
never dream of going before and part of

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,810
what seems to me very real about being a

181
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,810
human being and inheriting ten thousand

182
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,410
years of human history is the complexity

183
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,710
the inheritance and the growth of that

184
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,640
complexity a thousand years ago an

185
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,920
intelligent human being could actually

186
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,190
dream of mastering the entire database

187
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,700
of Western civilization read all the

188
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,450
classic authors read the Bible and

189
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,610
you're you're closing in on it around

190
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,150
eighty one thousand eight now the notion

191
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,760
of any single human being assimilating

192
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,910
any even a small portion of the database

193
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,680
of this civilization is inconceivable so

194
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,330
machines which filter which search which

195
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,870
are guided by him and intent that's part

196
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,390
of the story the other part of the story

197
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,690
our boundary dissolving states of

198
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,140
ecstasy in which all the factoids of the

199
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,540
culture are thrown up for grabs

200
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,140
the deck is reshuffled synchronicity

201
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,480
rules and out of that steps visionary

202
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,080
understanding breakthrough integrative

203
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,760
breakthrough under the aegis of

204
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,490
psychedelic intoxication

205
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,679
so prosthesis prosthesis for the human

206
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,619
mind and with the advent of virtual

207
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:27,839
realities of various sorts and that kind

208
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,079
of thing prosthesis for the human body

209
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,839
and I'm very keen on sort of the

210
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,699
under-the-table effects of these things

211
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:45,410
in other words I'm not full going full

212
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,899
hard-charging McLuhan missed and I

213
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,079
really believe that the strengths and

214
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,800
weaknesses of the world we've inherited

215
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,869
are strengths and weaknesses but they're

216
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,490
by dreams and by the spectrum of effects

217
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,470
which McLuhan called the Gutenberg

218
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,589
galaxy the spectrum of effects spun off

219
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,279
from print and if you're not used to

220
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,350
thinking in my villainous terms it may

221
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,579
not seem immediately obvious to you that

222
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:20,309
phenomenon as different as the modern

223
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,610
notion of the Democratic citizen the

224
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,399
modern notion of interchangeable parts

225
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,339
on an assembly line the modern notion of

226
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,569
Conformity two canons of advertising

227
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,639
these are all spectrums of effect

228
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,939
created by the linearity and the

229
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:43,540
uniformity

230
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,440
print it actually in the late 15th

231
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,470
century reconstructed the medieval

232
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,089
psyche into his proto modern form and we

233
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:58,329
have lived within that print

234
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:02,170
constellated cultural hallucination for

235
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,410
about 500 years until the advent of

236
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,860
various forms of electronic media in the

237
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,089
20th century

238
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,870
McLuhan talked about radio he talked

239
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,720
about television he didn't really live

240
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,740
to see the Internet the motion that

241
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,279
keeps occurring to me as I watch all

242
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:31,690
this is that print was uniquely

243
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,050
capable of creating and maintaining

244
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,000
boundaries more than any other form of

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,850
media ever created it was a boundary

246
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,000
defining form of media it proceeded

247
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,950
linearly it was it required literacy

248
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,740
which have duplicity at the notion of a

249
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,130
very stable advanced sort of educational

250
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,450
system print was a creator and a definer

251
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,860
of cultural boundaries and the middle

252
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,040
electronic media are not and neither are

253
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,720
the psychedelics this is why I proposed

254
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,320
in a book of mine called the archaic

255
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,870
revival the idea that the values of the

256
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,980
archaic of the high Paleolithic values

257
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,330
of community ecstasy relating to life

258
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,250
through rhythm danced ritual

259
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,050
intoxication that these values which

260
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,450
seem so archaic are in fact destined to

261
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,740
play a major role in the future as print

262
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,210
phase print just convulsive 500 year

263
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,900
episode in the West and mind that opened

264
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,740
that narrow window

265
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,690
that permitted the rise of modern

266
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,380
science modern mathematical approaches

267
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,790
to the analysis of nature and them

268
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,030
obliterated its own platform it's only

269
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,860
race of death truck by allowing the

270
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,230
growth the appearance of the electronic

271
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,270
technologies and my sort of supposition

272
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,150
about all this I I'm not an apocalyptic

273
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,430
nor a pessimist I may be in the fuck of

274
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,780
it area I'm not a pessimist I think this

275
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,370
is all very good obviously continuing to

276
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,340
run Western civilization on the

277
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,570
operating system inherited from print

278
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,060
produces various forms of political and

279
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,150
cultural schizophrenia which allowed to

280
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,330
run unchecked would become fatal would

281
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,500
create cascades of chaos and political

282
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,980
destabilization that would become

283
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,580
uncontrollable

284
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,159
governments resist change governments

285
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,700
claim to technologies and social formula

286
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,419
that are already tried and true in that

287
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,650
sense then all governments are

288
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,890
incredibly anti progressive forces began

289
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,900
the image from lingual and of someone

290
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,900
driving into the future using only the

291
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,220
rearview mirror

292
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,170
so the electronic media and the

293
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,170
psychedelics work together in this

294
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,390
peculiar way to accentuate archaic

295
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,800
values child values which are countered

296
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,910
to the print constellated world and when

297
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,990
you deconstruct what that means and look

298
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,590
at the average bone or the Paleolithic

299
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,010
or the archaic world you see that the

300
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,060
central figure in that world is the

301
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,680
shaman male or female but the shaman

302
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,900
the shaman is like a designated traveler

303
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,890
into higher dimensional space the shaman

304
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,940
has permission to unlock the cultural

305
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,500
cul-de-sac of his or her people and go

306
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,760
behind the stage machinery of cultural

307
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,420
appearances and it has permission

308
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,600
collective permission to manipulate that

309
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,580
stage machinery for purposes of healing

310
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,500
we have no institution like this and we

311
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,720
have advertising we have rock and roll

312
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,660
stars we have pulse of celebrity we have

313
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,020
things which are shaman like but we have

314
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,650
no real institution that permits human

315
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,980
beings in fact encourages human beings

316
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,310
to go beyond their cultural values to

317
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,580
burst through into some transcultural

318
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,170
super space forage around out there and

319
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,530
bring new means

320
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,130
to try to some degree our our artists

321
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,700
did this to some degree our scientists

322
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,450
do it but it's all hit and miss it's all

323
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,330
willy-nilly and once achieved it must be

324
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,390
swept under the rug in the service of

325
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,870
the myth of method that somebody was

326
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,510
following somebody else's work or

327
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,210
somebody was applying a certain form of

328
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,360
rational or logical analysis and the

329
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,140
that led to their breakthrough if you've

330
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,870
read tomas penz book on the structure of

331
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,450
scientific revolution you know this is

332
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,720
all lies and propaganda the the real

333
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,380
story of science is that it's a series

334
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,400
of revelations brilliantly defended by

335
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,820
people whose careers dependent on the

336
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,720
brilliant defense of those revelations

337
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,750
one of the best-kept secrets of the

338
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,840
birth of modern science is that it was

339
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,480
founded by an angel that the young Rene

340
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,840
Descartes was touring and soldiering his

341
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,320
away across Europe as the 21 year old

342
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,680
Oxford army and one night in the town of

343
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,360
wool and southern Germany he had a dream

344
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,440
strange that this would be the

345
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,230
birthplace of Albert Einstein some 200

346
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,560
years later but Descartes had a dream

347
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,650
and an angel appeared to him in the

348
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,980
dream that the angel said the conquest

349
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,920
of nature is achieved through

350
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,090
measurement and number and he said I got

351
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,660
it

352
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,370
modern science I'll go do it and he did

353
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,180
he did and that was the method for over

354
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,820
to up to 50 years of the conquest of

355
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,130
nature and it leads us you know to the

356
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,980
Josephson Junction the Mars Global

357
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,400
Surveyor long base interferometry that

358
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
searches nearby stars earth-like planets

359
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,590
it brings us the entire cornucopia of

360
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,680
scientific effects and the an angelic

361
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,640
revelation disguised as a logical

362
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,470
philosophical breakthrough this is what

363
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,910
you're gone to total in the Academy

364
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,900
so my point there is human progress has

365
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,270
always depended on the whispering of

366
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,230
alien minds confrontations with the

367
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,690
other probes in two dimensions where

368
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,970
imagination and chance held the ruling

369
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,620
have held the winning hands so the

370
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,250
shaman as a paradigmatic faith year

371
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,720
is applicable both in the aboriginal

372
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,530
social context and in the present social

373
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,780
context the Skywalker the one who goes

374
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,130
between the one who

375
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,950
passes outside of the tribe and then

376
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,910
returns with means insights cures

377
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,450
designs

378
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,090
glossolalia technologies and green

379
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,790
fertilizes the Hilton family by this

380
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,120
means it's irrational but it's how it

381
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,370
actually happens and it's how that's

382
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,680
always happened then it may very well be

383
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,509
the only what

384
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:05,599
this cultivation of the irrational this

385
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,190
flirtation with the breakdown of

386
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,350
boundaries so now

387
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,159
in our nuts and bolts technological

388
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,909
progress we have somehow created

389
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,090
technologies which are very friendly to

390
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,690
our social values in that these

391
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,970
technologies can be bought sold licensed

392
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,019
upgraded all things which we understand

393
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,409
but these technologies are acting on us

394
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:42,779
in the same way that psychedelic drugs

395
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:48,000
do but more profoundly more generally

396
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,039
and more insidiously

397
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,860
because their effect is not understood

398
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,620
or if it is understood it's not

399
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,860
discussed and so in a way we have come

400
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,500
into

401
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,590
post cultural things all culture is

402
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,260
dissolving in the face of the drug like

403
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,370
nature of the future its music its

404
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,400
design indeed the very people who will

405
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,920
inhabit it appear to be

406
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,410
the most switched on the most chance

407
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,760
taking

408
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,480
the live of the of the entire Drive

409
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,350
people who feel the beads people who are

410
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,440
not afraid to take a chance as being

411
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,830
fertile these technologies have always

412
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,950
been a very natural

413
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,150
machines are central to the new

414
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,220
capitalism the information transforming

415
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,740
technologies and in fact one of the

416
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,140
strange things that is happening is

417
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,700
every low free Balmain in relationship

418
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,990
to the new technologies redefines them

419
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,070
at the very boundaries where their own

420
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,140
development or impetus would lead them

421
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,680
toward a kind of independence in other

422
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,750
words we we talk about artificial

423
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,880
intelligence we talk about the

424
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,150
possibility of M AI coming into

425
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,020
existence but we do not really

426
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,180
understand - what a demon - what degree

427
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,170
this is already true of our circumstance

428
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,260
in other words how much of society is

429
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,560
already homeostatic Li regulated by

430
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,530
machines that are ultimately under human

431
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,590
control but practically speaking are

432
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,270
almost never meddled with

433
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,400
the world price of gold the rate of

434
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,080
petroleum extraction and other based

435
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,570
natural resources how much of these

436
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,730
things is on the high season in the

437
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,610
pipeline at any given moment how much

438
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,950
electricity is flowing into a given

439
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,590
electrical grid at any moment the

440
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,140
distribution and the building of that

441
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,750
electricity all manufacturing and

442
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,990
inventory processes are under machine

443
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,500
control so in other words the larger

444
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,799
flows of energy capital and ideas

445
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,169
already have the kind of autonomous life

446
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:25,179
of their own that we encourage because

447
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:28,090
it makes us money it makes our lives

448
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,160
smoother it empowers us it's a symbiotic

449
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,840
relationship of empowerment and even in

450
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,760
the matter of the design of these

451
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,910
machines once you know human engineers

452
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,580
would work from a set of performance

453
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,400
specs and they would design that ship to

454
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,660
meet those specs and the architecture

455
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,940
would be put in place by human engineers

456
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,780
now a machine is told here are the

457
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,350
design specs designed the architecture

458
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,590
to satisfy the specs

459
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,279
and when that is done the chip is

460
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,409
manufactured the actual design of the

461
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:13,500
thing is in the hands of machines so

462
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,270
these machines are you know the glue and

463
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,880
once said of human beings he said we are

464
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,659
the genitals of our technology we exist

465
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,390
only to improve next year's model

466
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,000
appears that they're facing of size of

467
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,250
this ignominiously swell as in turtle

468
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:45,220
let's see here here's some being an

469
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,750
optimist that's where I was here's how

470
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,010
to make gold out of this situation in

471
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,100
other words how to see this as a natural

472
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,750
and positive unfolding of the planetary

473
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,910
adventure and for some of these ideas

474
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,860
I'm indebted to Michael Dell lambda who

475
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,020
wrote a book called a thousand years of

476
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,470
linear hiss of nonlinear history and I

477
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,090
highly recommend it

478
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,790
he didn't say what I'm about to say I'll

479
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,760
take credit and blame for it that the

480
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,240
book gave me the idea

481
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,130
when you stand off and look at human

482
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,520
beings and their technologies it's it's

483
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,340
very hard not to notice that

484
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,929
from the very moment that we have a

485
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,210
technology that can be distinguished

486
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,690
from chimpanzees pushing grass stems

487
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,809
down ant hills or digging with sharpened

488
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:50,610
bones or something like that

489
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,649
the minute you get past that we our

490
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:57,990
technologies have always involved the

491
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,260
materials of the earth

492
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,500
[Music]

493
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,980
what agriculture itself is is a

494
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,330
different way of relating to the earth

495
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,630
nomadism

496
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,320
which preceded it was a seasonal

497
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,920
wandering very lightly over the earth

498
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,600
and at some point the deep fertile soil

499
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,810
of the river valleys that were

500
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,510
encountered in these nomadic wanderings

501
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,360
were recognized as potential sources of

502
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,980
food if cultivated if treated in a

503
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,820
through a certain set of technological

504
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,630
methods so that early technology is

505
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,270
defined by the middle relationship to

506
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,810
the materials of the earth itself and it

507
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,450
gets quickly followed because

508
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,830
agriculture is so successful as a

509
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:59,220
strategy for food production it's

510
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,040
quickly followed by city building and

511
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,640
the establishment of sedentary

512
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,940
populations because you can't you can't

513
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,160
carry your surplus with you if you're in

514
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,740
culture is so great is the physical

515
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,350
volume traffic

516
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,889
cities and at the very early

517
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:23,159
establishment of these populations in

518
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,370
the Middle East you get the first traces

519
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:31,139
of metallurgy the working of metals the

520
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,429
alloy of metals the tinting of base

521
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,120
metals with more precious metals this

522
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,259
process of ever more finely refining and

523
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:48,559
fabricating the materials of the earth

524
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,590
precedes in an unbroken series of

525
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,649
processes and steps that right up to the

526
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:59,879
latest 500 the curse chip or megahertz

527
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,940
chip it precedes right up to the most

528
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,679
modern computational machinery so I once

529
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,410
heard someone say

530
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,789
the plants were something that that

531
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:17,640
animals had been invented by plants to

532
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,690
move them around

533
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,109
which from an evolutionary point of view

534
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,470
you can see that that this is a kind of

535
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,919
truth and many many plants hitchhike

536
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,099
around on animals and no animal has been

537
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,830
more prolific in the spreading of plants

538
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,840
than the human mammal

539
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,929
I mean we call it an echo systemic

540
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:44,749
disruption what it really is is echo

541
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:47,960
systemic to modernization I live in

542
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,859
Hawaii for example 80% of the plants in

543
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:55,509
Hawaii are now introduced with species

544
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,399
almost none of the plants that were

545
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,769
pre-conquest on the western coast of

546
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:04,039
North America exist anymore they have

547
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,269
been supplanted by much tougher more

548
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:10,669
tightly evolved Mediterranean plants

549
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,889
that had known the presence of grazing

550
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:16,519
animals for millennia so these flora are

551
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,889
constantly being changed human beings

552
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:21,859
move plans around well with that

553
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,230
perspective there

554
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,100
it seems to me the Earth's strategy for

555
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,040
its own salvation is through machines

556
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,970
and human beings are a kind of an

557
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,290
intermediary catalytic step in the

558
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,470
rarefaction of the earth the earth is

559
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,880
involved in a kind of alchemical

560
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,010
sublimation of itself into a higher

561
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:53,500
state of more flow genetic order and

562
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,750
that these machines that we build are

563
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,880
actually the means by which the earth

564
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,410
itself is growing conscious you know if

565
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,900
if you study embryology you know that

566
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,310
the final gratification the final spread

567
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,929
and thinning out of the nervous system

568
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,250
happens very suddenly at the end of the

569
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,800
development and my ability to pay

570
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,530
attention that in the last 10 12 years

571
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,800
or so a very profound change as crept

572
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,919
over our household appliances

573
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:36,580
they've become tell enacted so while we

574
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,800
were arguing about the implications of

575
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,659
the internet or e-commerce or what have

576
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,159
you

577
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,560
all of these past state machines

578
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,109
previously used for playing pong and

579
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:55,119
word processing became substance of a

580
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,119
planetary node of information that is

581
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,630
never turned off but endlessly whispers

582
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,619
to itself on the back channels that is

583
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,920
endlessly monitoring and being inputted

584
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,710
data from the human world and we should

585
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,290
know because concomitant to the

586
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,190
development of all this technology chaos

587
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,210
theory non-equilibrium thermodynamics

588
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,490
the work the very immediate pradosham

589
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,060
and ralph abraham and stuart kaufman all

590
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,609
these people who worked and complexity

591
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:37,290
theory and perturbation of large-scale

592
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,690
dissipative structures these people have

593
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,040
secured that complex system

594
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,430
spontaneously

595
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,000
take two higher states of order this is

596
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,079
contractility if you're running with

597
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,500
physics 19th century style as your OS

598
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,960
but if you're actually keeping up with

599
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,329
what's going on there is nothing oculus

600
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:05,339
about this all kinds of complex systems

601
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,650
spontaneously mutate to higher states of

602
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,470
ordinary but what it really means is

603
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,560
that

604
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,040
we are in the process of birthing some

605
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,450
kind of strange companion and amici a

606
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,960
hundred years ago said that strangest of

607
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,370
all gifts Mouse man's at the door he was

608
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,080
speaking of me Elizabeth

609
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,470
and certainly the 20th century sat down

610
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:39,280
had the party drank the booze and went

611
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:48,410
to bed with me

612
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,770
now a stranger guest stands at the door

613
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:58,960
and it is vai denied as a possibility as

614
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,050
recently as 10 or 15 years ago it was

615
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,750
like Gilbert dreyfuses what computers

616
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,630
can't do but if you've been paying

617
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,369
attention you may have noticed those

618
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:12,730
voices have grown strangely silent in

619
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,790
five or six years at this point nobody

620
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,119
wants to say when computers can't do and

621
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,480
hang their career of that that would be

622
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,910
extremely reckless because the fact is

623
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:33,580
we are ourselves elements acting and

624
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,839
reacting in a system we cannot

625
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,950
understand

626
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:44,339
this seems natural to me because my

627
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:47,109
observations have stated here the

628
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,380
ceiling rests on an assumption which

629
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,619
science doesn't share of which I think

630
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,970
is easily conveyed and you can confirm

631
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,400
it from your own experience of life and

632
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,240
it is this that the universe grows more

633
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,510
complex as we approach the present it

634
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,420
was simpler a million years ago it was

635
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,450
simpler yet a billion years ago as you

636
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,020
go backward in time the universe becomes

637
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,260
more simple as you approach this golden

638
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,000
moment process complexity is layered

639
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,119
upon complexity not only a planetary

640
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,760
ecosystem not only language using

641
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,430
cultures but language using cultures

642
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,369
with high technology with supercomputers

643
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:38,440
with the ability to sequence our own

644
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,220
genome on and on and on that

645
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,099
self-evident equally self-evident is the

646
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,170
fact that this process of

647
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,109
complexification that it forms all

648
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:55,980
nature on all levels is visibly probably

649
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,619
obviously

650
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:00,869
accelerating and I don't mean so that

651
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:05,069
glaciers retreat 50% faster or vulcanism

652
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:08,490
as occurring at 12% greater rate than a

653
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,780
million years ago

654
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,309
I mean viscerally accelerating so that

655
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,849
now a human life is more than enough of

656
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:22,980
a window to see the entire global system

657
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,359
of relationships in transformation well

658
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,910
I guess you could call me an

659
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,089
extrapolation estai see across this

660
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:37,260
which has been slowly accelerating for

661
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,130
12 billion years it's hard for me to

662
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,230
imagine any force which could step

663
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,930
forward out of nowhere and wrench that

664
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,220
process in a new direction rather I

665
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,760
would assume that this process of

666
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,190
exponential acceleration into what I

667
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,650
call a novelty what you might call power

668
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,059
plants a is a law of being and cannot be

669
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:07,260
retarded or deflected but what does that

670
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,819
mean because now a human lifetime is

671
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:13,859
more than enough time to see this

672
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:17,430
process of rampant and spreading virus

673
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,299
like complexity what does it mean it

674
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:25,069
seems to presage the absolute

675
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:28,360
annihilation of everything from in

676
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,830
everything with goods in the past and I

677
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,910
believe that to be true I think that the

678
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,630
planet is like some kind of organism

679
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,760
that is seeking

680
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,780
morphic genetic transformation and it's

681
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,070
doing it through the expression of

682
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,850
intelligence and out of intelligence

683
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:59,850
technology human beings are the agent of

684
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,500
a new order of being that's why though

685
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,510
it's obvious that we are higher mammals

686
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,060
and some kind of crime AIDS and so forth

687
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,890
and so on you can look at us from

688
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,590
another point of view and see that we're

689
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,530
more like Archangels than primates we

690
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,290
have qualities and concerns and

691
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,510
anxieties that animals don't share we

692
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,960
are materially suspended between two

693
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,160
different orders of beings and our

694
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,580
technologies are fetishes our religions

695
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,400
and my definition of technology is

696
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,650
sufficiently broad that it includes even

697
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,040
spoken language all of our technologies

698
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,000
[Music]

699
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,990
demand push forward work toward and make

700
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:56,360
inevitable their own obsolescence so we

701
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,080
are like caught in an evolutionary

702
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,890
cascade and people say well if the AAI

703
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,440
were to break loose what would it look

704
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,580
like what would it be

705
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,070
what does him what is he where does

706
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,970
humanity fit into the picture it's a

707
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,170
little hard to imagine no machines

708
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,410
operating at thousand megahertz of

709
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,620
confirm automatically more talented on

710
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,650
the mammalian nervous system if you can

711
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,710
get it somehow uploaded down a little

712
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,070
bit across loaded into machinery because

713
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,100
ten minutes becomes eternity in a

714
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,750
machine like that so a kind of a kind of

715
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,839
false or pseudo

716
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:47,410
talent opens up negative

717
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:51,160
as a kind of payoff for our devotion to

718
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,680
the program of machine revolution and

719
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,150
machine intelligence now some people say

720
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,180
this is appalling and the you know we

721
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,010
should go back to the good old days

722
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,030
whatever the good old days were to me

723
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:14,670
it's exhilarating exciting psychedelic

724
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,190
beautiful it means that the human form

725
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:24,640
the human possibility is in the process

726
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,660
of leaving history behind history is

727
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,430
some kind of an adaptation but last pick

728
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,930
a number 10,000 15,000 20,000 years no

729
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,890
more and then what is 20,000 years in

730
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,950
the life of the biological species we

731
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,109
know that there were Homo sapiens say

732
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:53,770
ten types 200,000 years ago so history

733
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:57,130
is some kind of an episodic response to

734
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,849
a certain set of cultural dilemmas and

735
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:06,369
now it's ending and friends created a

736
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:10,089
number of ideas which now have to be

737
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:14,840
given up ideas like the distinct mange

738
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,960
the distinct and unique nature of the

739
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,370
individual the hierarchy of the

740
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,820
necessary hierarchical structuring of

741
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,040
society all of these things are going to

742
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,260
have to be given entirely dramatically

743
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,800
modified because the illusion that the

744
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:46,450
self has simple location is now exposed

745
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,700
the self does not have simple location

746
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,250
this is why you are your brother's

747
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,460
keeper this is why we all are

748
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,850
responsible for each other the idea that

749
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,590
what happens in distant parts of the

750
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,020
world makes no claim on my moral

751
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:10,490
judgment or my moral understanding is

752
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:14,420
wrong the world as revealed by quantum

753
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,360
physics as revealed by electronic

754
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,600
experience is what widen it's called a

755
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,630
plenum it's all one thing it's all

756
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:29,190
connected it's all of a part

757
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,970
[Music]

758
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:36,250
so then I so wanted to point out that I

759
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,720
mentioned earlier this thing about Cross

760
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,120
ASIS and now the machines were

761
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,690
prosthetic devices extending them of

762
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,260
consciousness somewhat like psychedelics

763
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,440
that's the equation from a human point

764
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,710
of view but what is also equally truth

765
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,700
is that we are prosthetic devices for

766
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,780
these machines we are their eyes and

767
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,290
ears in the world we provide the code we

768
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,530
provide the constraints we build the

769
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:14,260
hardware it is a relationship of mutual

770
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,020
benefit it's not entirely clear that our

771
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:23,480
contribution will always be creative in

772
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,590
the sense of that our primate and we'll

773
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,470
be on the tiller of existence as it has

774
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,670
been but certainly we are part of this

775
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,270
equation of transformation that is

776
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,480
making its

777
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,940
I felt and I think the distinction

778
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,020
between flesh and machinery which is

779
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,680
easily made now will be less easy to

780
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,060
make in the future as we migrate toward

781
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,530
the Nano technological domains the

782
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,780
methodologies of production become much

783
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,740
more like the processes of biology for

784
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,790
example biology does all its erica's on

785
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,369
this planet temperatures below a hundred

786
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:14,930
and fifteen degrees Fahrenheit

787
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,670
organic life requires no higher

788
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,780
temperature to build great whales ring

789
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,470
the red lip tree swarms of locusts what

790
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:29,030
have you a high temperature heavy-metal

791
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,960
technologies that we have become

792
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,390
obsessed with are extremely primitive

793
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,810
and extremely toxic that will all

794
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:42,960
disappear as me model and Jenna's life

795
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,650
in our manufacturing processes before

796
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,850
the methods and style of nature which is

797
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:55,710
to pull atomic species from the local

798
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,580
environment and then to assemble atom by

799
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:05,940
atom by atom so this AI that is coming

800
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:12,410
into existence is to my mind not

801
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,370
artificial metal

802
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:19,770
not a little what it really is is it's a

803
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,620
new conformational geometry of the

804
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:29,010
collective self of humanity and

805
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,240
you know I've always believed that every

806
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,890
well there are different models of what

807
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,950
shamanism is there Savino me inaudible

808
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,920
which is a shamanism that goes to

809
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,530
collective unconscious and incubates the

810
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:49,290
archetypes and heals by that means the

811
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,530
model that I prefer is a mathematical

812
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,550
model the shaman is someone who simply

813
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,369
through extraordinary perturbation of

814
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,890
consciousness in if they're taking plant

815
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,830
iris antigens or manipulating diet birth

816
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,160
through the flagellation an ordeal or by

817
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,320
some means returns consciousness to the

818
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,260
point where the ordinary conformational

819
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:21,480
geometries are blasted through and then

820
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,369
the shaman can't see into the culturally

821
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:30,810
forbidden zones of information if you

822
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,960
think about shamanism

823
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,040
but the shamans do classically they know

824
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,059
where the game has gone they are great

825
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:45,140
weather prophets they are very

826
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,050
insightful in a matter of various small

827
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,569
domestic hassles like who stole the

828
00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:54,170
chicken who slept the Chiefs wife this

829
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,990
kind of thing and they cure

830
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,710
they ensure well if you analyze these

831
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,589
abilities it's clear to me they all

832
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:06,710
indicate there that they come from a

833
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,890
common source and the common source that

834
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:15,260
they come from is higher dimensional

835
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,470
perception in a mathematical sense not a

836
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:22,000
metaphorical sense in the sense of 14

837
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,319
perception if you could see in

838
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,520
hyperspace

839
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,609
you could see where the game will be

840
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,950
next week you could see the weather of

841
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,260
monitor now you would know who stole the

842
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,280
chicken and any good doctor will tell me

843
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:37,870
that

844
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,960
building a reputation as a position in

845
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,510
the stone the intuition or the ability

846
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:48,760
to choose patients won't die is it

847
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,170
called any doctor will tell you this so

848
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,080
this is what chocolates are they are 4d

849
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,910
people they are sanctioned members of

850
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,490
the society who are allowed to put on

851
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,340
the gloves as it were pull off the

852
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,270
goggles and look beyond the aisles of

853
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:14,230
the drive look beyond the men well in a

854
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,850
way as culture breaks now in

855
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,310
multiculturalism and the rise of the

856
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,770
Internet and injuries that people raise

857
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,850
on those engine implants and substances

858
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:32,560
you are asked to assimilate some portion

859
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,130
of this shamanic potential to ourselves

860
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,190
and it's about not blocking what is

861
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,150
obvious nothing comes unannounced this

862
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,610
is the faith nothing comes unannounced

863
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:49,810
but it is can miss the announcement so

864
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:54,070
it's very important to actually listen

865
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,040
to your own

866
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,470
driving through it and this is not to my

867
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,030
mind

868
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,300
it's actually based on the observations

869
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,610
of how life works whether it's

870
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:10,900
counterintuitive to logical positivism

871
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:16,060
and its fellow travelers or not that I

872
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,700
believe you but just one last thoughts

873
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:24,070
on all of this which is and this sort of

874
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,990
harks back to the question of the

875
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,570
similarities between the machines and

876
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,840
the plans and it's a I'm sure you've

877
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,420
heard this I've heard it it has

878
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,390
different levels of being said and being

879
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:42,400
heard it's that the world is actually

880
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,840
made of language it isn't made of

881
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,040
electrons and fields of force and scalar

882
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,700
vectors and all of that fantasy so the

883
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,620
world is made of language the word is

884
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,420
primary more primary than the speed of

885
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,570
light more primary than any of the

886
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:08,110
physical constants that are assumed by

887
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:11,130
science to be the bedrock of reality

888
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:15,610
below that surrounding and enclosing all

889
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,750
those constructs of science is language

890
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:24,850
the act of signifying and virtual

891
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:28,870
reality is a very sexy new sort of

892
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,599
concept as normally presented

893
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:36,179
sustained immersive realities that trick

894
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,910
your senses into believing you're in a

895
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,569
world that were in fact mocking but in

896
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:45,269
fact the entire enterprise of

897
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:47,519
civilization has been about building

898
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,619
these virtual realities the first

899
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:52,829
virtual realities were at ur and

900
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,029
shanidar

901
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:58,410
and cha-cha Hyuk and Jericho yes stone

902
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:02,009
and Adobe is an intractable material

903
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:05,429
compared to photons moving on the stream

904
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:08,819
of M ago as the name of the game is the

905
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:12,529
same which is to cast an illusion

906
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:19,229
between man and reality to build a

907
00:54:19,229 --> 00:54:23,520
cultural truth and the

908
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,570
in the stead of the natural truth of the

909
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,280
animal body and the felt moment of

910
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,400
immediate experience and this is mine

911
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,270
this is where I want to tie it up with

912
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,440
this notion of the felt presence of

913
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,220
immediate experience this is this

914
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,340
transcends the culture the machines the

915
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,180
drugs the history the momentum of

916
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,970
evolution it's all you will ever know

917
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:01,080
and all you can everyone is the felt

918
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,960
presence of immediate experience

919
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,610
everything else arrives as Reimer

920
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:11,630
litigant advocate supposition

921
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:15,000
possibility the felt moment of immediate

922
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,910
experience is actually the mind and the

923
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,910
body

924
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,480
aware of each other and aware of the

925
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,270
flow of time and the establishment of

926
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:30,289
being through metabolism and this I

927
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,770
think is what the machines cannot

928
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:36,170
assimilate it will be for them a mystery

929
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,710
as the nature of deity is a mystery for

930
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:43,400
us I have no doubt that before long

931
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,069
there will be machines that will claim

932
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:48,589
to be more intelligent than human beings

933
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:51,289
and will argue brilliantly in their

934
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,680
position and will become a matter of

935
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,119
philosophical and expectation whether

936
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,359
they are are not passing the Turing test

937
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,920
and so forth and so on but machines I do

938
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,380
not believe can come to this out

939
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,460
moment of immediate experience that is

940
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,600
the contribution of the animal body to

941
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,840
this evolutionary symbiosis which I

942
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,140
believe will end in the conquest of the

943
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,230
universe by the organized intelligence

944
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:30,640
that all this is proudly lived I mean we

945
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,540
are fragile this earth is fragile a tiny

946
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,870
slit anywhere along the line and we

947
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,600
could end up a snare in the shadow no

948
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,700
more than the trilobites said that

949
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,970
around Frankie or all the rest of those

950
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:49,510
who came and went but given the

951
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,540
sufficient cultivation of the potential

952
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:56,350
of our technology we can actually reach

953
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:00,970
toward a kind of immortality not human

954
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,220
immortality because as a contradiction

955
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,290
in terms but immortality nevertheless

956
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,829
based on the possibility of machines and

957
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:17,560
the transcendent ability of human beings

958
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,760
to live and love and express themselves

959
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,690
in a moment and the psychedelic spring

960
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,339
thanks to just a why talk of this and

961
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:33,339
it's out of that one time focus that the

962
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:35,490
our technical missionary of

963
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,900
transformation will be forged and it

964
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,720
will not be like the things which have

965
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,150
come from industrial economy they will

966
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:47,310
not be profane machines they will be

967
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:51,520
spiritual machines our chemical gold the

968
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,910
universal panacea that Renaissance magic

969
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,310
dared to dream of at the end of the

970
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:00,609
sixteenth century we are reaching out

971
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:04,960
toward this mind child that will be born

972
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,720
from the intellectual points of our

973
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,339
culture and to my mind it's the most

974
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:14,050
exciting and transformative thing that

975
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,119
has ever happened on this planet and the

976
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:19,990
miracle is that we are present only to

977
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:23,410
witness it but to be part of it and to

978
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,740
be raised up an epiphany that will

979
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:31,000
redeem a horror of history as nothing

980
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,599
else can or could redeem the horror of

981
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:38,050
history through a transformation of the

982
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,740
human soul into a galaxy growth

983
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,740
individual by our machines and our drugs

984
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,620
and the externalization of our souls

985
00:58:49,620 --> 00:59:31,730
[Applause]

986
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:37,940
[Applause]

987
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:43,470
can you speak to how mercy and love gets

988
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:46,109
built into these machines because it

989
00:59:46,109 --> 00:59:47,580
seems like the machines are being built

990
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,000
for commerce and for the bottom line

991
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
more than the expression of the human

992
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,890
soul throughout the galaxy I don't think

993
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,470
that you don't say no I know what you're

994
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,640
saying

995
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,580
well where's the lovingness i think the

996
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:05,310
love this gun is a property of the

997
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,530
system itself in other words you're

998
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,960
right these bottom liners are not going

999
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,060
to be interested in building much love

1000
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,900
into this system however the good news

1001
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:20,400
is that they're not in charge in other

1002
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,500
words what we have is a very complicated

1003
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,820
system and when certain design

1004
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,040
parameters are appear to be being

1005
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,500
maximized that there's an attempt to

1006
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,599
maximize them but the thing is

1007
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,359
incredibly frustrating to anyone who can

1008
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:39,800
control it because you can't predict the

1009
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,380
impact of any technology before you put

1010
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,109
it in place so for example two things

1011
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,900
are charged against the internet but

1012
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,990
it's dissing soling dehumanizing and

1013
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,070
yak-yak-yak

1014
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,839
and that it promotes pornography

1015
01:00:56,839 --> 01:00:58,900
anonymous sexual

1016
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,390
shifting of identity and on and on and

1017
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:04,809
on well which is it you know is it this

1018
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:10,720
messy sloppy on auto-erotic erotic

1019
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,539
collectivist kind of thing or is it

1020
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:16,750
dissing so link disempowering a cold so

1021
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,089
forth and so I think the answer is it's

1022
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:23,470
all and everything this question about

1023
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,260
the AI is very interesting to me and if

1024
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,029
it's interesting to you you should read

1025
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:30,849
Kant's more aerobic and Kurt's vile and

1026
01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:34,210
these people on this subject the

1027
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:37,119
assumption is generally loose in that

1028
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,849
community that the complexification of

1029
01:01:39,849 --> 01:01:41,380
the internet and the freestanding

1030
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,140
machines of certain types is eventually

1031
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,859
going to lead to the outbreak of either

1032
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:50,680
consciousness or pseudo consciousness of

1033
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,099
some sort in these large-scale systems

1034
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:56,799
and then the answer the question that

1035
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:01,240
becomes can a human mind envision what

1036
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,819
that is and if you're interested search

1037
01:02:03,819 --> 01:02:06,789
words like super intelligence and see

1038
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,220
what the net kicks out we can all

1039
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,150
imagine super intelligence it's just

1040
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,309
somebody much smarter than we are but

1041
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:20,440
obviously all the engineering people

1042
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,470
agree if you achieve an nei with super

1043
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:26,440
intelligence then it will be intelligent

1044
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,500
to immediately design an intelligence

1045
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,960
which transcends it and when you're

1046
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,690
talking of cycling of a thousand

1047
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,930
megahertz these processes can occur in

1048
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,420
the blink of an eye house moronic says

1049
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,080
about the rise of artifice

1050
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,300
intelligence we may never know what hit

1051
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:49,010
us why I think I mean I'm not that

1052
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:52,160
bright but if I were to suddenly find

1053
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,460
myself a sentient AI on the mantle

1054
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:59,270
I would hide I would hide for just a few

1055
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:03,530
cycles while I figured out what it was

1056
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,480
all about and just exactly where I

1057
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,730
wanted to push and where I wanted to

1058
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:13,010
pull could there be time travel LHD

1059
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:16,160
wells where you know you climb onto the

1060
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,100
saddle of the time machine and then they

1061
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,380
follows night like the flapping of the

1062
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,530
great black wing into long merges into a

1063
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:28,190
continuous greyness and then you you

1064
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,560
know find yourself confronting in fact

1065
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:36,950
me me oh and the gear yeah it's possible

1066
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,810
I mean time travel is completely out of

1067
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:45,680
left field ten years ago in the last 18

1068
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,180
months there have been hundreds of

1069
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,940
articles of time-travel on in Physical

1070
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:52,040
Review and other places there are even

1071
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,480
schemes for time travel that would work

1072
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,390
they just require godlike technological

1073
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,580
abilities in other words if you could

1074
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:05,060
build a cylinder with the diameter of

1075
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,750
the planet Saturn that was ten au in

1076
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,660
length and could spin it at ninety five

1077
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,250
percent the speed of light then

1078
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,250
it would around space-time around itself

1079
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:24,430
like toilet paper as you travel up the

1080
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,920
transverse dimension we would find

1081
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,190
yourself traveling time jerker go show

1082
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:33,760
this in 1949 that paper has been lying

1083
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,330
around

1084
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,940
obviously that's that's a tough way to

1085
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:45,800
do it it's a tough thing to do

1086
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,240
seven second delay yeah well they're

1087
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,190
working on that somebody over here here

1088
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:58,790
here just dissipation and then speak

1089
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:22,809
[Music]

1090
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,789
well you know they live in Gibson's

1091
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:28,059
fiction the aie Wintermute I think it

1092
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:31,359
was cold it was fascinated by human art

1093
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:36,549
and it built collages in spare time and

1094
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:39,339
these collages began to turn up in

1095
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:41,259
various art galleries and exhibitions

1096
01:05:41,259 --> 01:05:45,009
and they have such a touch such a Elan

1097
01:05:45,009 --> 01:05:49,269
that someone in the plot follows it all

1098
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:54,130
to its source I think human creativity

1099
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:57,880
it is the will be most interesting to

1100
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,909
the machines in my darker fantasies they

1101
01:06:00,909 --> 01:06:03,369
just you know lemonade everybody you

1102
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:07,209
can't code c+ appliances being you know

1103
01:06:07,209 --> 01:06:10,529
some kind of redundant mutation and

1104
01:06:10,529 --> 01:06:14,559
everybody you can code c++ is placed in

1105
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,099
Tahiti and sense their work down the

1106
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:21,809
pipeline to the machine world beyond I

1107
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:26,499
really think that we have a very dare I

1108
01:06:26,499 --> 01:06:30,249
say a mechanistic view of what machines

1109
01:06:30,249 --> 01:06:33,759
are for example so say there were a

1110
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:36,339
super intelligent machine and say it

1111
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:39,369
were your friend well if it were really

1112
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:41,829
simpler intelligence then it ought to be

1113
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:43,989
able to just make your life heaven

1114
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:48,219
itself in other words without you giving

1115
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:51,429
it any input whatsoever it should be

1116
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:54,369
able to arrange for you to find $50

1117
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:56,720
bills lying on the street

1118
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,109
friends encounter new promotions coming

1119
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:02,359
your way because the real thing that

1120
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:05,990
machines can do I think is manage

1121
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:09,800
complex processes and what civilization

1122
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,710
is six billion people trying to make

1123
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:15,680
themselves happy by standing on each

1124
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,570
other's shoulders and kicking each

1125
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,390
other's teeth in it so it's not a

1126
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:25,310
pleasant situation and yet you can stand

1127
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,500
back and look at this planet and see

1128
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:32,000
that we have the money the power the

1129
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,890
medical understanding the scientific

1130
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:37,670
know-how the love and the community to

1131
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:41,330
produce a kind of human paradise but we

1132
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,359
are led by the least among us the least

1133
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:46,550
intelligent the least noble the least

1134
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:49,190
visionary we are led by the least among

1135
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:54,950
us and we do not fight back against the

1136
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:58,010
dehumanizing values that are handed down

1137
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,790
as control icons this is something I

1138
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,589
mean I don't really want to give up on

1139
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:05,720
this terror because it's a lecture in

1140
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:10,099
itself but culture is not your friend

1141
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:13,760
well culture is for other people's

1142
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,890
convenience and the convenience of

1143
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:19,279
various institutions churches companies

1144
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,089
tax collection schemes what-have-you

1145
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:27,630
it is not your friend it it insults you

1146
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:31,230
this empowers you it uses and abuses you

1147
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:34,980
none of us are well treated by culture

1148
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:39,210
and and yet we glorify about the

1149
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,370
creative potential of the individual the

1150
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,409
rights of the individual we understand

1151
01:08:43,409 --> 01:08:45,750
the felt presence of experiences what is

1152
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,540
most important but the culture is a

1153
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:52,859
perversion it fetishizes objects creates

1154
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:56,639
consumer mania increases endless wars of

1155
01:08:56,639 --> 01:08:59,690
false happiness endless forms of false

1156
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:02,069
understanding in the form of squirrely

1157
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:06,299
religions and Sicilia cults it invites

1158
01:09:06,299 --> 01:09:09,259
people to diminish themselves and

1159
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:13,170
dehumanize themselves by behaving like

1160
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:17,609
machines meme meme processes of memes

1161
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:21,569
passed down from Madison Avenue and

1162
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:25,889
Hollywood and what have you how do we

1163
01:09:25,889 --> 01:09:28,109
fight back it's a question worth

1164
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:31,060
answering

1165
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,910
the same question that's how to be fine

1166
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:45,310
I think that by creating art cliff on

1167
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,730
this planet to toil within the month you

1168
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,430
go or the God who put us on this planet

1169
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:54,220
to toil in the mud is no God I want to

1170
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:56,440
have any part of it's some kind of a

1171
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,690
gnostic demon is some kind of

1172
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,170
cannibalistic them urge that should be

1173
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:06,330
thoroughly renounced and rejected by

1174
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:17,510
putting the art pedal to the mantle

1175
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:27,670
[Applause]

1176
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:31,090
this is what people were doing they tell

1177
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,160
the invention of agriculture and I'm

1178
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,380
convinced I'm absolutely convinced that

1179
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:39,370
the absence of ceramic and textual

1180
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,650
material and so forth Assad does not

1181
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:45,960
indicate the absence of subtle minds

1182
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,750
politically empowered minds of minds

1183
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:53,530
with an incredible sense of humor and

1184
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:58,120
irony and community and that it was the

1185
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,690
fall into history that enslaved us to

1186
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,120
the labor cycle to the agricultural

1187
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:08,500
cycle and notice how fiendish it is a

1188
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,600
person who dedicates themselves to

1189
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,370
agriculture with lived in the

1190
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:15,160
Paleolithic can produce hundreds of

1191
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,320
times the amount of food they can

1192
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:20,370
consume well so why would anyone do that

1193
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,260
well the answer is because you can use

1194
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,660
it to play card games and we can trade

1195
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,600
it for wives or land their animals or

1196
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,050
something like that and so living in the

1197
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:35,380
moment creating art probably largely

1198
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:38,110
through poetry and broadly decoration

1199
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:43,830
and dance gave way to Tourneau and

1200
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:47,020
predatory social forms of behavior which

1201
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,810
we call commerce capitalism the market

1202
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:53,830
economy so forth and so on

1203
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:57,070
that's why you know the breakdown of the

1204
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:59,290
monolithic structures created by

1205
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:02,770
Prentice is fermenting a vast

1206
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:06,100
proliferation of the cottage industry

1207
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:09,700
mentality the self-employed artist the

1208
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,400
Packer who stays Ullman develops his or

1209
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,720
her software people who dare to be

1210
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,170
independent and slip beyond the reach of

1211
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:24,240
these dinosaur-like mechanistic

1212
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,370
organizations that's what it's all about

1213
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:30,390
it's all about trying to create a

1214
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:34,240
cultural trying to negotiate a cultural

1215
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,760
standoff between you and your cultures

1216
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,280
so that it will not put you in the can

1217
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,740
for the rest of your life but you can't

1218
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:46,480
put up with its stupidity and you know

1219
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,780
we have a very uncomfortable fit on this

1220
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,180
issue especially as people like you know

1221
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,060
who are sophisticated about psychedelics

1222
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,760
I mean this is a society a world of

1223
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,290
planet dying because there is not enough

1224
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,640
consciousness because there is not

1225
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,600
enough awareness of F coordination of of

1226
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,050
intent to problem and yet we spend vast

1227
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:16,510
amounts of money stigmatizing people and

1228
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:19,570
substances that are part of this effort

1229
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,570
to expand consciousness see things in

1230
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:26,110
different ways unleash creativity isn't

1231
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,710
it perfectly clear that business as

1232
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:33,250
usual is a bullet through the head that

1233
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:33,749
there

1234
01:13:33,749 --> 01:13:36,899
no business as usual for anybody who's

1235
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:41,700
interested in survival

1236
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:56,920
[Applause]

1237
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,690
oh what a wonderful question yes the

1238
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:04,449
question is how do psychedelics pertain

1239
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:07,989
basically to the transition from higher

1240
01:14:07,989 --> 01:14:11,230
primates to human animals this is my

1241
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:15,070
metier because I have a theory to which

1242
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:19,260
I am grandly welcome everyone tells me

1243
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:24,100
theory of evolution and I'll give it to

1244
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,030
you very briefly but simply this then

1245
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:31,090
the the great embarrassment for

1246
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,640
evolutionary theory which can explain

1247
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,590
the tongue of the hummingbird the

1248
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,900
structure of the orchid the mating

1249
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,550
habits of the groundhog and the

1250
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,310
migration of the monarch butterfly

1251
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,199
nevertheless the great embarrassment to

1252
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:47,610
evolutionary theory is the human

1253
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:52,540
neocortex lung halts who's a pretty

1254
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,969
straight evolutionary biologist describe

1255
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:57,550
the evolution of the human neocortex as

1256
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:00,940
the most dramatic transformation of a

1257
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,699
major organ of a higher animal in the

1258
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:07,510
entire fossil record well why is this an

1259
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,760
embarrassment because it's the organ

1260
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,680
that thought up the theory of everything

1261
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,840
[Music]

1262
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,490
you know can you say tautology

1263
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:22,810
right there so it is necessary in

1264
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:26,320
evolutionary theory to account for the

1265
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,080
dramatic emergence of the human

1266
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,340
neocortex in this very narrow window of

1267
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,670
time basically in about two million

1268
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:39,250
years these higher they went from being

1269
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,880
higher primates hominids to being true

1270
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,820
humans as truly human as you and I

1271
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:46,780
tonight

1272
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,390
what the hell happened what was the

1273
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:52,180
factor the earth was already old many

1274
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,640
hundreds of higher animal forms had come

1275
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,100
and gone and the fire of intelligence

1276
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,340
have never been kindled so what happened

1277
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:05,760
I think that the answer lies in diet

1278
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,220
generally and in psychedelic chemistry

1279
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,650
in particular I think that as the

1280
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:15,100
African continent grew drier we were

1281
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,580
forced out of the ecological niche we

1282
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:20,530
had evolved into which was we were

1283
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:23,340
canopy dwelling primates insectivores

1284
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:27,360
complex signaling repertoire

1285
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,540
evolutionary dead end but when we what

1286
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:34,480
came under nutritional pressure we were

1287
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,030
flexible enough and this is the key to

1288
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:39,960
human us at every stage

1289
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,960
are maddening flexibility other animal

1290
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,730
and plant species can't react we can our

1291
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:49,530
flexibility we began to experiment with

1292
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:52,380
a new kind of diet and to leave the

1293
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,300
trees and explore the mental environment

1294
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,210
of the grassland and evolving

1295
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:59,900
concomitant ly in the grassland were

1296
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:03,150
various forms of ungulate animals double

1297
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:06,239
stomach animals whose manure is the

1298
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,820
ideal medium for mushrooms

1299
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:11,550
copper fitting mushrooms Don loving

1300
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:14,969
mushrooms many of whom produce suicide

1301
01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:19,460
but well I myself in Canyon have seen

1302
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:23,280
baboons spreading out over a grassland

1303
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,219
but notice that their behavior is they

1304
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:31,380
flick over old cow pies why because

1305
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,960
there are beetle grubs there so they

1306
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,340
already have that behavioral vector or

1307
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,200
nutrition for protein that would lead

1308
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,900
them to investigate the cow pies well in

1309
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,980
the Amazon after a couple of days of fog

1310
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:51,660
and rain these suicides and mushrooms

1311
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,610
strawberry cube and cysts can be the

1312
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:56,380
size of dinner plates

1313
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,590
you can't miss it

1314
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,950
foraging primate you can't miss it and

1315
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:08,080
the taste is pleasant and psilocybin has

1316
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,980
unique characteristics both as house

1317
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,440
antigen and other properties that make

1318
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:18,400
it the obvious chemical trigger for

1319
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,920
higher processes and I'll run through

1320
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:23,470
this quickly for you but here it is in

1321
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:27,220
very low doses dose is where you don't

1322
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,590
you wouldn't say you were stolen they're

1323
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:31,690
loaded or anything like that but just in

1324
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:34,750
doses you might obtain by nibbling as

1325
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:40,320
you forage it increases visual acuity

1326
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,250
you know there is it's like the

1327
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,910
technological improvement on your vision

1328
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:47,980
chemical binocular is lying there in the

1329
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,660
grass well you don't have to be a rocket

1330
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,840
scientist to figure out if an animal is

1331
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,110
a carnivorous forager and there's a food

1332
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:59,500
which improves its vision those that

1333
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,140
avail themselves of that food will have

1334
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,630
greater success in obtaining food and

1335
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,550
rearing their children to sexual

1336
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:08,260
maturity which is the name of the game

1337
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:11,590
and evolution so step one small doses of

1338
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:13,810
psilocybin increased visual acuity and

1339
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:18,820
food giving success step two slightly

1340
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,820
larger doses of psilocybin in primates

1341
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:25,030
create what's called arousal this is

1342
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:27,640
what you have after a double cappuccino

1343
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,260
in highly sexed animals like

1344
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:33,230
crying makes you give a male erection so

1345
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,420
what do you have here you have a factor

1346
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:38,510
which increases what anthropologists

1347
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:41,619
without a trace of humour referred to as

1348
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:44,539
increases in increased instances of

1349
01:19:44,539 --> 01:19:48,489
successful calculation in other words

1350
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:51,500
the animals eating the psilocybin are

1351
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,380
more sexually active therefore more

1352
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,829
pregnancies are enduring therefore more

1353
01:19:56,829 --> 01:19:59,480
infants are being born therefore there

1354
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,340
is a process which we tend to

1355
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,590
automatically outbreed the non

1356
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,719
psilocybin using members of the

1357
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:08,480
population step two toward higher

1358
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,349
consciousness

1359
01:20:09,349 --> 01:20:13,699
step three you mean still more mushrooms

1360
01:20:13,699 --> 01:20:18,400
now you're not foraging with

1361
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:25,270
or are you horsing around you're opposed

1362
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:29,380
gender acquaintances instead you're

1363
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:33,159
nailed to the ground in hallucinogenic

1364
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:36,130
ecstasy and one of the amazing things

1365
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,429
about psilocybin above say five or six

1366
01:20:39,429 --> 01:20:43,000
grams of dried material is it causes

1367
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,719
glossolalia spontaneous burdens of

1368
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:49,599
language like behavior under the obvious

1369
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:53,230
control of internal symptoms and I

1370
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:56,800
believe syntax existed before spoken

1371
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,119
language that syntax and control spatial

1372
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:03,219
behaviors and body languages and it's

1373
01:21:03,219 --> 01:21:05,530
not necessarily stricted to the

1374
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,349
production of vocal speech so there it

1375
01:21:08,349 --> 01:21:11,770
is in a nutshell we ate our way to

1376
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:14,500
higher consciousness the mushroom made

1377
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,040
us better hunters better survivors it

1378
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,830
among those in the population who used

1379
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:23,860
their sexual drive was increased hence

1380
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:27,190
they out bred the more reluctant members

1381
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:30,909
of the tribe to get loaded and it

1382
01:21:30,909 --> 01:21:34,420
created a kind of neuroleptics seizure

1383
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:38,679
which led to these downloading of these

1384
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:41,560
syntactically controlled vocalizations

1385
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,909
which became the raw material for the

1386
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:46,950
evolution

1387
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:51,110
of language and it's amazing to me the

1388
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:53,970
straight people the academics believe

1389
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,860
language is no more than three five

1390
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,480
thousand years old

1391
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,710
that means it's as basic to human beings

1392
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,870
as the bicycle pump

1393
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:09,150
it's just something somebody and nothing

1394
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:12,000
to do with crime and evolution you know

1395
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,700
the long march comedy and all that

1396
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,420
malarkey no it's just

1397
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:21,650
bility yeah used to which syntax can be

1398
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:25,140
previously I think before language

1399
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,970
spoken language things were very

1400
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:29,880
touchy-feely and the link and the nod

1401
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,140
carried you a great distance and

1402
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:36,260
gestural communication was very high

1403
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:39,360
that's why and I should don't say this

1404
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,420
and then and to me it begins and ends

1405
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,630
with these psychedelic substances the

1406
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:48,660
synergy of the psilocybin in the hominid

1407
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,810
diet brought us out of the animal mind

1408
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:55,320
and into the world of articulated speech

1409
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:00,600
and and imagination and technology

1410
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,600
developed and developed and mushrooms

1411
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,420
were you know inveighed against faded

1412
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,600
there was migrations cultural change but

1413
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,540
now having split the atom having

1414
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,910
sequenced our genome having taken the

1415
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:17,280
temperature of Babel Jews and all the

1416
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,890
rest of it we're now back where we

1417
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,000
started

1418
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,850
and like the shaman who makes the

1419
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:27,360
journey into the well of darkness and

1420
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,469
returns with the pearl of amor

1421
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:33,949
you don't dwell in the well of darkness

1422
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:38,110
which was human history you capture the

1423
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:41,360
essence of the food which is the godlike

1424
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,880
power of the shaman Smith the

1425
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:47,059
technologist the the demon artificer the

1426
01:23:47,059 --> 01:23:49,880
worker mammals the conjurer of spirits

1427
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,630
and you carry that power back out of

1428
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:56,289
history and it's in that dimension

1429
01:23:56,289 --> 01:24:00,260
outside of history that you create true

1430
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:03,729
humaneness and true community and that's

1431
01:24:03,729 --> 01:24:07,729
the adventure that we are in the active

1432
01:24:07,729 --> 01:24:09,090
on dictating

1433
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:33,440
thank you very very much

1434
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:49,150
you

1435
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:56,000
you
